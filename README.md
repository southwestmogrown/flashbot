# FlashBot!

FlashBot is a simple Discord bot that I built to help my classmates and I study, as well as challenge myself to build something new and without tutorials. 

Commands:
  Say hi, FlashBot! - FlashBot will respond with a greeting.
  It's Alive! - FlashBot will react with ðŸ¤–
  !flash - FlashBot will randomize a question and answer from a predetermined index object.
  !flashfact - FlashBot will send a fetch request to a Random Facts API and treat you with some truly random facts.
  robot - If the word 'robot' appears anywhere in the conversation, regardless of letter casing, FlashBot gets a little uneasy. 


I hope to figure out how to build and serve an API to store all the flash cards in so they aren't saved directly in the file.  
I also plan on adding to the chat responses and reactions to keep it fun throughout the rest of school.
